# Build a Recipe Page

A small, responsive static web project that demonstrates how to structure and style a recipe page. This repository contains a single, easy-to-read `index.html` with supporting styles and layout suitable for learning and quick customization.

**Status:** Complete — ready to view locally or adapt.

**Purpose:** This project is a beginner-friendly exercise to practice HTML and CSS by building a recipe page layout similar to FreeCodeCamp curriculum challenges.

**Demo:** Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a simple HTTP server (instructions below).

**Contents**

- **Project:** A single-page static recipe layout showcasing ingredients, directions, and a hero image.
- **Files:** `index.html` (main page) — additional assets may be added by you (images, fonts, CSS modules).

## Getting Started

To preview the page locally, you have two simple options:

- Open the file directly in your browser: double-click `index.html` or right-click -> Open With -> your browser.
- Serve the project with a local static server (recommended for consistent asset loading):

```bash
# using Python 3 (macOS / zsh)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — main recipe page HTML
- `README.md` — this file

Add more files (images, CSS, JS) into the project root or a new `assets/` folder as needed.

## How to Use / Customize

- Replace the placeholder text and sample ingredients with your own recipe details.
- Swap the hero image by adding an image file and updating the `<img>` `src` in `index.html`.
- Modify styles by editing or adding a CSS file and linking it from `index.html`.

## Development Notes

- This is a static page; no build tools are required. Keep changes minimal and test in-browser frequently.
- If you add JavaScript or preprocessors, include a short README section describing build steps and dependencies.
