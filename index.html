        <hr>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/4 tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
                <li> 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 F / 45 C - warm to the touch, not hot)</li>
                <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour (bread flour works too)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tsp sugar (helps feed the yeast)</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Activate Yeast</strong>: In a large bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast.  Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Make Dough</strong>: Add olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour. Stir until combined.
                Gradually add the rest of the flour, mixing until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Knead</strong>: Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead for 6-8 minutes (until smooth and elastic).
                Or knead with a stand mixer + dough hook for 5 minutes</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>First Rise</strong>: Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, 
                and let rise for 1 hour (until double in size).</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Shape & Bake</strong>: Punch down dough, divide if making smaller pizzas.  Roll out to your desired
                thickness.  Add sauce, cheese, and toppings.  Bake at <strong>475F (245C) for 12-15 minutes</strong> until
                crust is golden and cheese is bubbly.</li>
